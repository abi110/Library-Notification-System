    "Separate lists for only 'date-of-loan' and 'date-returned' were created in order to allow for calculations. <br>\n",
    "Function 'returns()' subtracts date_returned from date_loaned returning a list of the number of days that a book was on loan for, while also excluding any books that were not returned from the list. <br>\n",
    "Function 'late()' works by taking the library's standard loan period of 14 days and taking numbers of more than 14 from the 'returns()' list and adding them to a separate list. <br>\n",
    "Calculations were coded and stored as either 'avg_length', 'percentage_late', or 'avg_late'. <br>\n",

    "# Sanity checks\n",
    "The data was cleaned so only books loaned in 2019 remained, books with a book number of over 120 was also removed as was the data for books that were not returned.\n",
    "# Quality of Data\n",
    "The data definately lacked in quality, there were gaps in the data. Some of the Titles and Autor names were missing from the books.csv, specifcally this data was missing from book numbers 81, 84, 104, 114, and 119. I made the decision to leave this data in the data that was used as I made the assumption that the library had this data and it was just the data file provided that was incomplete. This does affect the quality of the results. In addition to this the bookloans.csv had book numbers up to 140 whereas books.csv only had 120, meaning that data had to be deleted as there was not Title or Autor recorded for it. The Library needs to be keeping the data files up-to-date.\n",
    "Due to the data being incomplete we can conclude that the library needs to improve the integrity of the data as the data has not been kept up-to-date and has significant amounts of data missing.\n",
    "# How Data Quality Might Inform Case Study Project Going Forward\n",
    "A computersied solution created for the library must take into account the shortfalls mentioned above regarding the quality of the data. It was not previously known that the data held by the library lacked data integrity. Now knowing this the computerised system must be able to store new books and have a simple UI for volunteers to input new data for the books where they can be added to books.csv. The new system must be able to notify volunteers at the library if data is missing from a column in the books.csv file so that it can be input into the system. The new system should also notify the library that a book has not been returned so that this issue can be resolved as the database should be storing the name and address for each member number. Implementing these resolutions will aid the library to maintain the data and ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "# Assumptions Made\n",
    "The assumptions that had to be made were that 0 indicated that the book was never returned, and that the data provided was accurate and reliable despite the data integrity being comprimised.\n",
    "# Extent To Which I Feel The Completed Tasks have met the Requirements Set\n",
    "## Design:\n",
    "Functions were used throughout the assignment in order to create lists, count frequency, and look up data to return a report. Lists and dictionaries were used widely for data structure to store data and pass to other functions. Functions were tested throughout the code to make sure that the functions were operating as required. When errors presented themselves within the code they were handled and corrected within the code. Both books.csv and bookloans.csv were connected to produce reports that were functional. Bookloans.csv was cleaned so that only dates within 2019 remained, and books with a book number of 1-120, and books that had not been returned were also removed.\n",
    "## Functionality:\n",
    "Task 1 functions as required by the question, with the code producing a Report indicating the book number, frequency that book was loaned in 2019, along with the book's titles and author. <br>\n",
    "Task 2 functions as required by the question, with the code producing a report of the most popular genres and sub-genres of books borrowed along with the frequency that the genre or subgenre was borrowed. <br>\n",
    "Task 3 functions as required by the question, with the code producing a report that states the average length of time that a book was on loan, the percentage of loaned books that were returned late, the average length of time that a book that was returned late was on laon for and the everage late period. <br>\n",
    "## Documentation:\n",
    "Markdown was used at the end of each question to explain how code was used to produce the report. Code was also commented throughout the Assignment to provide commentary and improve code readability. My opinion of the quality of the data provided was also given."
